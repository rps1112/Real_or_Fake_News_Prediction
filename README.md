Title: News Veracity Detector

**Description:**

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying news articles as either real or fake. The goal is to create a model that can assist in identifying the credibility of news sources.

**Key Components:**

1. Logistic Regression Algorithm: We used the Logistic Regression algorithm for binary classification, where the two classes represent real and fake news articles. Logistic Regression is a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

2. Text Conversion Algorithms: We employed text preprocessing techniques to clean and convert the raw text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning. These techniques include lowercasing, removing punctuation, tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

3. Python Libraries: We leveraged several Python libraries for this project, including:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
   - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating machine learning models.
   - `NLTK` for natural language processing tasks like stop word removal.
   - `GitHub` for version control and sharing the project.

**Workflow:**

1. Data Preparation: We gathered a dataset containing labeled news articles, where each article was tagged as real or fake.

2. Text Preprocessing: We cleaned and preprocessed the text data, including removing special characters, lowercasing, and transforming text into TF-IDF vectors.

3. Model Training: Using Logistic Regression, we trained a binary classification model on the preprocessed data.

4. Model Evaluation: We evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Deployment: We created a simple REST API using Flask to deploy the trained model, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
